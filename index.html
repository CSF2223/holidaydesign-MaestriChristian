                <p>Christmas trees are popular in Greece, but you’ll also find boats wrapped in strings of lights, whether in the water or in the main square.
There are two explanations for the boat-decorating phenomenon: The first is that the country’s ancient maritime tradition means boats have always
been an integral part of the culture, so they were decorated long before a modernized version of Christmas (including trees) came along.
The second is that St. Nicholas is considered the patron saint of sailors, which is probably why boats are decorated on December 6th.</p>

                <cite>Dongzhi Festival</cite>
                <p>The Dōngzhì Festival is China's take on winter solstice, although the festival is also observed in Korea, Vietnam and more.
In modern times, the Chinese New Year has overshadowed winter solstice, since the more popular spring festival occurs just six weeks later.
As such, the winter solstice is no longer a public holiday in China, but many families still continue the practice, which entails paying
homage to ancestors and eating tangyuan (sticky rice balls in sweet soup).</p>

                <p>The thirteen troll-like Yule Lads are like a mashup between Santa Claus and dwarves, since each has a different name and personality,
and each leaves gifts in children’s shoes for the 13 nights before Christmas. Unless kids are bad, in which case they get rotten potatoes,
or worse, the Yule Lads’ mom, Gryla, will boil them in a cauldron. The lads are a mischievous bunch, who mostly steal food and other items and slam doors.
For example, there’s the Pot Licker, who steals leftovers and then licks the pot clean, and the Skyr Gobbler, who has a penchant for stealing Icelandic yogurt.
But, these are small prices to pay for gifts.</p>
